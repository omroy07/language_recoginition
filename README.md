# Language Model Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of a language model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## 📁 File Overview

- `language-model.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook demonstrating the NLP model workflow.
- `vectorization.pkl` – Saved vectorizer for transforming input text data.
- `label_encoder.pkl` – Encoder used to convert class labels to numerical form.
- `dataset.csv` – The dataset used for training and evaluating the language model.
- `templates/index.html` – HTML template for the web application frontend.
- `app.py` – Flask application script to serve the model via a web interface.


## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Building a language model using deep learning (e.g., RNN/LSTM/Transformer)
- Model training and evaluation
- Text generation or other NLP tasks

## 🧰 Technologies Used 

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on what's used in your notebook)
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-model-project.git
   cd language-model-project
2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 📊 How to Run

Launch the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash

# Language Model Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of a language model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## 📁 File Overview

- `language-model.ipynb`: The main notebook that includes all code and outputs for the language model pipeline.

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Building a language model using deep learning (e.g., RNN/LSTM/Transformer)
- Model training and evaluation
- Text generation or other NLP tasks

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on what's used in your notebook)
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-model-project.git
   cd language-model-project
``
2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 📊 How to Run

Launch the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook language-model.ipynb
```
